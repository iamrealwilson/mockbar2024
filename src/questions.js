    "text": "Upon seeing the global popularity of Korean culture, the President of the Philippines wanted to export Philippine culture as well. Thus, he met with both the Secretary of Tourism and the Chairperson of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts to come up with a plan to make Philippine culture the next big thing. After a series of meetings with industry stakeholders and with a resolution of support from Congress, the President issued a presidential proclamation granting tax exemptions to members of the Philippine entertainment and culinary industries who export 70% of their products and services. The proclamation also grants additional tax incentives (such as an income tax holiday) to artists, directors, chefs, studios (both TV and music), and authors who gain international acclaim. Is the proclamation constitutional? Explain your answer.",

    "text": "Pedro ran a gambling den in the basement of a bar called Apolaki in Intramuros, Manila. His gambling operations consisted of a pastime from the late 1700’s called “Ratting”, where barrels of rats would be released in a fenced-off area for a cat to eat. Bettors would then wager on how many rats would be killed by the cat in a certain given time. As can be easily gathered, this is highly illegal. The apparent illegality did not stop Pedro from making millions of pesos from onsite and online bettors. Needless to say, Pedro did not file an income tax return to report his income. Based on the complaint of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Department of Justice filed an information against Pedro for Failure to File Income Tax Return under Section 255 of the National Internal Revenue Code. In his defense, Pedro argued that the profits from the gambling operations are not income in the first place because declaring such would violate his right against self-incrimination. Hence, he is not required to file any income tax return. Is the argument of Pedro tenable? Explain.",

From March to April 2023, Marites asked her daughter, Laya, to work as an intern in the corporation and help around the press room. Her main duties were brewing coffee for the editorial staff and printing out hard copies of TNO blog posts for filing purposes. Laya did a decent (but not excellent) job as an intern in her two-month stint with TNO, except for the one time when she added two packets of sugar to the cup of coffee of a diabetic senior officer. Proud of the performance of Laya, Marites issued a TNO resolution granting a ₱2 million bonus to Laya. Laya used the ₱2 million bonus to buy a new car. Can TNO claim the ₱2 million bonus as a deduction? Explain your answer.",
