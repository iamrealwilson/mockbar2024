Before Ricky died, he executed a will which when submitted to probate was opposed by Arnel on the ground that he should be given the share of his father, Franco. Is the opposition of Arnel correct? Why? (2012 BAR)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO, his opposition is not correct. Arnel cannot inherit from Ricky in representation of his father, Franco. The representative must not only be a legal heir of the person he is representing but he must also be a legal heir of the decedent he seeks to inherit from. While Arnel is a legal heir of Franco, he is not a legal heir of Ricky because an illegitimate child has no right to inherit ab intestato from the legitimate children and relatives of his father or mother (Art. 992). Arnel is disqualified to Inherit from Ricky because Arnel is an illegitimate child of Franco and Ricky is a legitimate relative of Franco.\n\n\n"

Not all of the relatives within the third degree will inherit as reservatario, and not all of those who are entitled to inherit will inherit in equal shares.

Dr. Fuentes left for the United States, passed the New York medical licensure examinations, resided therein, and became a naturalized American citizen. He died in New York in 2007. The laws of New York do not recognize holographic wills or compulsory heirs. (2009 Bar Question)\n\nCan the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes be admitted to probate in the Philippines? Why or why not?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nYes, the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes may be admitted to probate in the Philippines because there is no public policy violated by such probate. The only issue at probate is the due execution of the will which includes the formal validity of the will. As regards formal validity, the only issue the court will resolve at probate is whether or not the will was executed in accordance with the form prescribed by the law observed by the testator in the execution of his will. For purposes of probate in the Philippines, an alien testator may observe the law of the place where the will was executed (Article 17, NCC), or the formalities of the law of the place where he resides, or according to the formalities of the law of his own country, or in accordance with the Philippine Civil Code (Art. 816, NCC).Since Dr. Fuentes executed his will in accordance with Philippine law, the Philippine court shall apply the New Civil Code in determining the formal validity of the holographic will. The subsequent change in the citizenship of Dr. Fuentes did not affect the law governing the validity of his will. Under the New Civil Code, which was the law used by Dr. Fuentes, the\n\nlaw in force at the time of execution of the will shall govern the formal validity of the will (Article 795, NCC).\n\n"

(3%) (2009 BAR)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo, Jay cannot insist because under New York law he is not a compulsory heir entitled to a legitime. The national law of the testator determines who his heirs are, the order that they succeed, how much their successional rights are, and whether or not a testamentary disposition in his will is valid (Article 16, NCC). Since, Dr. Fuentes was a US citizen, the laws of New York determines who his heirs are. And since New York law does not recognize the concept of compulsory heirs, Jay is not a compulsory heir of Dr. Fuentes entitled to a legitime.\n\n\n"
