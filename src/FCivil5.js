On June 2, 2012, they agreed on the purchase price of P600,000 and that Sergio would give Marcelo up to June 30, 2012 within which to raise the amount. Marcelo, in a light tone usual between them, said that they should seal their agreement through a case of Jack Daniels Black and P5,000 \"pulutan\" money which he immediately handed to Sergio and which the latter accepted. The friends then sat down and drank the first bottle from the case of bourbon. On June 15, 2013, Sergio learned of another buyer, Roberto, who was offering P800,000 in ready cash for the land. When Roberto confirmed that he could pay in cash as soon as Sergio could get the documentation ready, Sergio decided to withdraw his offer to Marcelo, hoping to just explain matters to his friend. Marcelo, however, objected when the withdrawal was communicated to him, taking the position that they have a firm and binding agreement that Sergio cannot simply walk away from because he has an option to buy that is duly supported by a duly accepted valuable consideration.

A contract to sell is a specie of conditional sale. The contract to sell does not sell a thing or property but the right to buy the property. In a conditional sale, compliance with the condition automatically gives the right to the vendee to demand the delivery of the object of the sale, while this is not the case in a contract to sell.

On March 20, 2008, they executed another “Agreement to Buy Back/Redeem Property” where Ariel was given an option to repurchase the property on or before March 20, 2010 for the same price.

Noel rejected the redemption claiming that the DAS was a true and valid sale representing the true intent of the parties.
