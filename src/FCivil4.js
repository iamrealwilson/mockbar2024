    "text": "5.   What are obligations without an agreement”? Give five examples of situations giving rise to this\ntype of obligation. (2007 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\n“Obligations without an agreement” are obligations that do not arise from contract such as those arising from: 1. delicts; 2. quasi-delicts; 3. solution indebiti; 4. negotiorum gestio; and 5. all other obligations arising from law.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\n“Obligations without an agreement” refer to the juridical relation of quasi-contract to the end that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another. (Art. 2142, NCC)\n\nFirst example, is a case of negotiorum gestio, whereby one who voluntarily takes charge of the agency or management of the business or property of another, without any power from the latter, is obliged to continue the same until the termination of the affair and its incidents, or to require the person concerned to substitute him, if the owner is in a position to do so (Art. 2144, NCC).\n\nSecond example, a case of solutio indebiti may also give rise to an obligation without an agreement. This refers to the obligation to return which arises when something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake (Art. 2154, NCC).\n\nThird example, is when without the knowledge of the person obliged to give support, it is given by a stranger, the latter shall have a right to claim the same from the former, unless it appears that he gave it out of piety and without intention of being repaid (Art. 2164, NCC).\n\nFourth example, is when through an accident or other cause a person is injured or becomes seriously ill, and he is treated or helped while he is not in a condition to give consent to a contract, he shall be liable to pay for the services of the physician or other person aiding him, unless the service has been rendered out or pure generosity (Art. 2167, NCC).\n\nFifth instance of an obligation without an agreement is when the person obliged to support an orphan or an insane or other indigent person unjustly refuses to give support to the latter, any third person may furnish support to the needy individual, with right of reimbursement from the person obliged to give support. The provisions of this article apply when the father or mother of a child under eighteen years of age unjustly refuses to support him (Art. 2166, NCC).\n\n"

    "questionId": "6",
    "text": "6.   Gary is a tobacco trader and also a lending investor. He sold tobacco leaves to Homer for delivery within a month, although the period for delivery was not guaranteed. Despite Gary's efforts to deliver on time, transportation problems and government red tape hindered his efforts and he could only deliver after 30 days. Homer refused to accept the late delivery and to pay on the ground that the agreed term had not been complied with.  As lending investor, Gary granted a Pl,000,000 loan to Isaac to be paid within two years from execution of the contract. As security for the loan, Isaac promised to deliver to Gary his Toyota Innova within seven (7) days, but Isaac failed to do so. Gary was thus compelled to demand payment for the loan before the end of the agreed two- year term.\n\n1) Was Homer justified in refusing to accept the tobacco leaves? (2013 Bar Question)\n\nA)  Yes. Homer was justified in refusing to accept the tobacco leaves. The delivery was to be made within a month. Gary's promise of delivery on a \"best effort\" basis made the delivery uncertain. The term, therefore, was ambiguous.\nB)  No. Homer was not justified in refusing to accept the tobacco leaves. He consented to the\nterms and conditions of the sale and must abide by it. Obligations arising from contract have\nthe force of law between the contracting parties.\nC)  Yes. Homer was justified in his refusal to accept the delivery. The contract contemplates an obligation with a term. Since the delivery was made after 30 days, contrary to the terms agreed upon, Gary could not insist that Homer accept the tobacco leaves.\n\nD) No. Homer was not justified in refusing to accept the tobacco leaves. There was no term in the contract but a mixed condition. The fulfillment of the condition did not depend purely on Gary's will but on other factors, e.g., the shipping company and the government. Homer should comply with his obligation.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER: B or D.\n\n2) Can Gary compel Isaac to pay his loan even before the end of the two-year period? (2013 Bar\nQuestion)\n\nA)  Yes, Gary can compel Isaac to immediately pay the loan. Non-compliance with the promised guaranty or security renders the obligation immediately demandable. Isaac lost his right to make use of the period.\nB)  Yes, Gary can compel Isaac to immediately pay the loan. The delivery of the Toyota Innova is\na condition for the loan. Isaac's failure to deliver the car violated the condition upon which the loan was granted. It is but fair for Gary to demand immediate payment.\nC)  No, Gary cannot compel Isaac to immediately pay the loan. The delivery of the car as security for the loan is an accessory contract; the principal contract is still the P 1,000,000 loan. Thus, Isaac can still make use of the period.\nD) No, Gary cannot compel Isaac to immediately pay the loan. Equity dictates that Gary should\nhave granted a reasonable extension of time for Isaac to deliver his Toyota Innova. It would be unfair and burdensome for Isaac to pay the P1,000,000 simply because the promised security was not delivered.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA.\n\n[Under Art 1198 (2) of the Civil Code, the debtor shall lose every right to make use of the period when he does not furnish to the creditor the guaranties or securities which he has promised.]\n"

    "text": "14.  Juliet offered to sell her house and lot, together with all the furniture and appliances therein, to Dehlma. Before agreeing to purchase the property, Dehlma went to the Register of Deeds to verify Juliet’s title. She discovered that while the property was registered in Juliet’s name under the Land Registration Act, as amended by the Property Registration Decree, it was mortgaged to Elaine to secure a debt of P80,000. Wanting to buy the property, Dehlma told Juliet to redeem the property from Elaine, and gave her an advance payment to be used for purposes of releasing the mortgage on the property. When the mortgage was released, Juliet executed a Deed of Absolute Sale over the property which was duly registered with the Registry of Deeds, and a new TCT was issued in\n\nDehlma’s name. Dehlma immediately took possession over the house and lot and the movables therein Thereafter, Dehlma went to the Assessor’s Office to get a new tax declaration under her name. She was surprised to find out that the property was already declared for tax purposes in the name of XYZ Bank which had foreclosed the mortgage on the property before it was sold to her. XYZ Bank was also the purchaser in the foreclosure sale of the property. At that time the property was still unregistered but XYZ Bank registered the Sheriffs Deed of Conveyance in the day book of the Register of Deeds under Act. 3344 and obtained a tax declaration in its name.\n\nc) Who owns the movables inside the house? (2008 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nUnless there is a contrary stipulation in the absolute deed of sale, Dehlma owns the movables covered by the Deed of Sale and her ownership is perfected by the execution and delivery of public document of sale. The delivery of the absolute deed of sale is a symbolical delivery of the house and lot, including the contents of the house. This is an obligation to deliver a specific thing, which includes the delivery of the specific thing itself and all of its accessions and accessories even though they may not have been mentioned (Art.\n1166, CC).\n\n"

    "text": "15.  AB Corp. entered into a contract with XY Corp. whereby the former agreed to construct the research and laboratory facilities of the latter. Under the terms of the contract, AB Corp. agreed to complete the facility in 18 months, at the total contract price of P10 million. XY Corp. paid 50% of the total contract price, the balance to be paid upon completion of the work. The work started immediately, but AB Corp. later experienced work slippage because of labor unrest in his company. AB Corp.’s employees claimed that they are not being paid on time; hence, the work slowdown. As of the 17th month, work was only 45% completed. AB Corp. asked for extension of time, claiming that its labor problems is a case of fortuitous event, but this was denied by XY Corp. When it became certain that the construction could not be finished on time, XY Corp. sent written notice canceling the contract, and requiring AB Corp. to immediately vacate the premises.\n\na) Can the labor unrest be considered a fortuitous event? (2008 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nLabor unrest is not a fortuitous event that will excuse AB Corp. from complying with its obligation of\nconstructing the research and laboratory facilities of XY Corp. It is not the direct cause of non- compliance\nby AB Corp. It is independent of its obligation. It is similar to the failure of a DBP borrower to pay her loan just because her plantation suffered losses due to the cadang-cadang disease. It does not excuse compliance with the obligation (DBP vs. Vda. de Moll, 43 SCRA 82 [1972])\n\nADDITIONAL ANSWER:\n\nThe labor unrest in this case is not a fortuitous event. The requisites of fortuitous event are:\n\n(1) the event must be independent of human will or at least of the debtor’s will; (2) the event could not be foreseen, or if foreseen, is inevitable; (3) the event must have rendered impossible debtor’s compliance of the obligation in a proper manner; and (4) the debtor must not be guilty of concurrent negligence (Lasam v Smith, 45 Phils. 657 [1924]). All the requisites are absent in this case. AB Corp. could have anticipated the labor unrest which was caused by delays in paying the laborer’s wages. The company could have hired additional laborers to make up for the work slowdown.\n\nc) Must AB Corp. return the 50% downpayment? (2008 Bar Question)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo, under the principle of quantum meruit, AC Corp. has the right to retain payment corresponding to his percentage of accomplishment less the amount of damages suffered by XY Corp. because of the delay or default.\n\n"

    "text": "16.  A. Sara borrowed PS0,000.00 from Julia and orally promised to pay it within six months. When Sara tried to pay her debt on the gth month, Julia demanded the payment of interest of 12o/o per annum because of Sara's delay in payment. Sara paid her debt and the interest claimed by Julia. After rethinking, Sara demanded back from Julia the amount she had paid as interest. Julia claims she has no obligation to return the interest paid by Sara because it was a natural obligation which Sara voluntarily performed and can no longer recover. Do you agree? Explain.  (2015 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA) No, the case is not one of a natural obligation because even if the contract of loan is verbal, the delay of Julia made her liable for interest upon demand by Sara.  This is not a case of a natural obligation but a civil obligation to pay interest by way of damages by reason of delay. (Article 1956; Article 1169; Article\n2209 Civil Code)\n\nB. Distinguish civil and natural obligations. (2015 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nB) A civil obligation is based on positive law which gives a right of action to compel their performance in\ncase of breach.  A natural obligation is based on equity and natural law and cannot be enforced by court action but after voluntary fulfilment by the obligor,they authorize the retention of what may have been delivered or rendered by reason thereof.

    "text": "17.  Juancho, Don and Pedro borrowed P150,000.00 from their friend Cita to put up an internet cafe orally promising to pay her the full amount after one year. Because of their lack of business know- how, their business collapsed. Juancho and Don ended up penniless but Pedro was able to borrow money and put up a restaurant which did well. Can Cita demand that Pedro pay the entire obligation since he, together with the two others, promised to pay the amount in full after one year? Defend your answer. (2015 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO, Cita cannot demand that Pedro pay the entire obligation because the obligation in this case is presumed to be joint. The concurrence of two or more creditors or of two or more debtors in one and the same obligation does not imply that each one of the former has a right to demand, or that each one of the latter is bound to render, entire compliance with the prestation (Art. 1207). In a joint obligation, there is no mutual agency among the joint debtors such that if one of them is insolvent the others shall not be liable for his share.\n\n"

    "text": "18.  X, a dressmaker, accepted clothing materials from Karla to make two dresses for her day. On the X was supposed to deliver Karla's dresses, X called up Karla to say that she had an urgent matter to attend to and will deliver them the next day. That night, however, a robber broke into her shop and took everything including Karla's two dresses. X claims she is not liable to deliver Karla's dresses or to pay for the clothing materials considering she herself was a victim of the robbery\n\nwhich was a fortuitous event and over which she had no control. Do you agree? Why? (2015 Bar\nQuestion)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO, I do not agree with the contention of X. The law provides that except when it is otherwise declared by stipulation or when the law provides or the nature of the obligation requires the assumption of risk, no person shall be liable for those events which could not be foreseen or which though foreseen were inevitable (Art. 1174). In the case presented, X cannot invoke fortuitous event as a defense because she had already incurred in delay at the time of the occurrence of the loss (Art. 1165).\n\n"

They accepted the PS0,000.00 payment of Kyla to do her portrait but X passed away without being able to do it. Can Kyla demand that Y deliver the portrait she had paid for because she was dealing the with business establishment and not with the artist personally? Why or why not? (2015 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO, Kyla cannot demand that Y deliver the portrait. The death of X has the effect of dissolving the partnership (Art. 1830). Also, while the obligation was contracted by the partnership, it was X who was supposed to create the portrait for Kyla. Since X died before creating the portrait, the obligation can no longer be complied because of impossibility of performance (Art. 1266). In obligations to do, the debtor shall be released when the prestation becomes legally or physically impossible without the debtor’s fault.\n\nB) In this jurisdiction, is a joint venture (i.e., a group of corporations contributing resources for a specific project and sharing the profits therefrom) considered a partnership?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nYES, under Philippine law, a joint venture is understood to mean an organization formed for some temporary purpose and is hardly distinguishable form a partnership since its elements are similar which are: community of interest in business, sharing of profits, and losses, and a mutual right of control (Primelink Properties v. Lazatin, G.R. No. 167379, June 27, 2006 citing Blackner v. Mcdermott, 176 F. 2d 498[1949]).\n\n"

Amoroso agreed and paid MSI the amount of P50,000.00. After two (2) other payments, Amoroso stopped making further payments.\n\nBuddy filed a complaint for collection of the balance of the obligation and damages against J.C. J.C. denied any liability claiming that its obligation was extinguished by reason of novation which took place when MSI accepted partial payments from Amoroso on its behalf.  Was the obligation of J.C. Construction to MSI extinguished by novation? Why? (2014 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO, the obligation of JC was not extinguished by novation. Novation may either be objective or subjective. Subjective novation takes place by the substitution of debtor or subrogation of a third person to the rights of the creditor. Novation by substituting a new debtor may take place even without the knowledge or against the will of the original debtor but not without the consent of the creditor. In the case of JC, it does not appear that MSI had agreed to release JC from the obligation. Hence, the obligation of JC was not extinguished.\n\n\n\n"

(2011 Bar Question)\n\nA)  No, since consignation without tender of payment is allowed in the face of the conflicting claims on the plaintiff.\nB)  Yes, as owner of the property sold, Billy can demand payment directly to himself.\nC)  Yes, since Allan made no announcement of the tender.\nD) Yes, a tender of payment is required for a valid consignation.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER: A\n\n"

To buy a new car, she obtained a loan from the same bank in the amount of P1,200,000.00, payable in twelve monthly installments. Sarah issued in favor of the bank in post- dated checks, each in the amount of P100,000.00 to cover the twelve monthly installment payments. On the third, fourth and fifth months, the corresponding checks bounced.\n\nThe bank then declared the whole obligation due, and proceed to deduct the amount of one million pesos (P1,000,000.00) from Sarah's deposit after notice to her that this is a form of compensation allowed by law. Is the bank correct? Explain. (2009 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo the bank is not correct, while the Bank is correct about the applicability of compensation, it was not correct as to the amount compensated.\n\nA bank deposit is a contract of loan, where the depositor is the creditor and the bank the debtor. Since Sarah is also the debtor of the bank with respect to the loan, both are mutually principal debtors and creditors of each other. Both obligations are due, demandable and liquidated but only up to the extent of P300,000 (covering the unpaid third, fourth and fifth monthly installments). The entire one million was not yet due because the loan has no acceleration clause in case of default. And since there is no retention or controversy commenced by third persons and communicated in due time to the debtor, then all the requisites of legal compensation are present but only up to the amount of P300,000. The bank, therefore, may deduct P300,000 pesos from Sarah's bank deposit by way of compensation.\n\n"

    "text": "36. Eduardo was granted a loan by XYZ Bank for the purpose of improving a building which XYZ leased from him. Eduardo, executed the promissory note (“PN”) in favor of the bank, with his friend Recardo as cosignatory. In the PN, they both acknowledged that they are “individually and collectively” liable and waived the need for prior demand. To secure the PN, Recardo executed a real estate mortgage on his own property. When Eduardo defaulted on the PN, XYZ stopped payment of rentals on the building on the ground that legal compensation had set in. Since there\n\nwas still a balance due on the PN after applying the rentals, XYZ foreclosed the real estate\nmortgage over Recardo’s property.\n\nRecardo opposed the foreclosure on the ground that he is only a co-signatory; that no demand was made upon him for payment, and assuming he is liable, his liability should not go beyond half the balance of the loan. Further, Recardo said that when the bank invoked compensation between the rentals and the amount of the loan, it amounted to a new contract or novation, and had the effect of extinguishing the security since he did not give his consent (as owner of the property under the real estate mortgage) thereto.\n\na) Can XYZ Bank validly assert legal compensation? (2008 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nXYZ Bank may validly assert the partial compensation of both debts, but it should be facultative\ncompensation because not all of the five requisites of legal compensation are present (Article 1279, N.C.C.).\nThe payment of the rentals by XYZ bank is not yet due, but the principal obligation of loan where both Eduardo and Recardo are bound to pay the entire loan, is due and demandable without need of demand. XYZ Bank may declare its obligation to pay rentals as already due and demand payment from any of the two debtors.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nLegal compensation can be validly asserted between the bank, Eduardo and Recardo. This is a case of facultative obligation, thus, the bank can assert partial compensation. Banks have an inherent right to set off where both obligations are due and demandable (Art. 1279, CC)\n\nc) Does Recardo have basis under the Civil Code for claiming that the original contract was novated? (2008 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nOne of the three kinds of novation is applicable. There is no objective novation, whether express or implied, because there is no change in the object or principal conditions of the obligation. There is no substitution of debtors, either. Compensation is considered as abbreviated or simplified payment and since Recardo bound himself solidarily with Eduardo, any facultative compensation which occurs does not result in partial legal subrogation. Neither Eduardo nor Recardo is a third person interested in the obligation under Art 1302, CC.\n\n"

Under the terms of the contract, AB Corp. agreed to complete the facility in 18 months, at the total contract price of P10 million. XY Corp. paid 50% of the total contract price, the balance to be paid upon completion of the work. The work started immediately, but AB Corp. later experienced work slippage because of labor  unrest in his company. AB Corp.’s employees claimed that they are not being paid on time; hence, the work slowdown. As of the 17th month, work was only 45% completed. AB Corp. asked for extension of time, claiming that its labor problems is a case of fortuitous event, but this was denied by XY Corp. When it became certain that the construction could not be finished on time, XY Corp. sent written notice canceling the contract, and requiring AB Corp. to immediately vacate the premises.\n\nb) Can XY Corp. unilaterally and immediately cancel the contract? (2008 Bar Question)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo. XY Corp cannot unilaterally and immediately cancel the contract because there is need for a judicial action of rescission. The provisions of Art. 1191 of the Civil Code providing for rescission in reciprocal obligations can only be invoked judicially (Escueta v. Pando, 76 Phil. 256 [1946]; Republic v. Hospital de San Juan de Dios, 84 Phil. 820 [1949]).\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nYes, XY Corp. may unilaterally cancel the obligation but this is subject to the risk that the cancellation of the reciprocal obligation being challenged in court and if AB Corp. succeeds, then XY Corp. will be declared in default and be liable for damages (U.P. v. de los Angeles, 35 SCRA 102 [1970]).\n\n"

As a defense, Butch claims that there was already an arrangement with Hagibis on the payment of the loan. To implement the same, Butch already surrendered five (5) service utility vehicles (SUVS) to the company for it to sell, and the proceeds to be credited to the loan as payment. Was the obligation of Buich extinguished by reason of dacion en pago upon the surrender of the SUVs? Decide and explain. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNo, the obligation of Butch to Hagibis was not extinguished by the mere surrender of the SUV’s to the latter. Dation in payment whereby property is alienated to the creditor in satisfaction of a debt in money, shall be governed by the law of sales. (Article 1245). In dacion en pago, as a special mode of payment, the debtor offers another thing to the creditor who accepts it as equivalent of payment of an outstanding debt. The essential elements of a contract of sale, namely; consent, object certain, and cause or consideration must be present. There being no mention in the facts that Hagibis has given its consent to accept the SUVs as equivalent payment, the obligation of Butch is not thereby extinguished by mere delivery of the SUVS.\n\n"

    "text": "39. Jerico, the project owner, entered into a Construction Contract with Ivan for the latter to construct his house. Jojo executed a Surety undertaking to guarantee the performance of the work by Ivan, Jerico and Ivan later entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) revising the work schedule of ivan and the subcontractors. The MOA stated that all the stipulations of the original contract not in conflict with said agreement shall remain valid and legally effective. Jojo filed a suit to declare him relieved of his undertaking as a result of the MOA because of the change in the work schedule. Jerico claims there is no novation of the Construction Contract Decide the case and explain. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nI will decide in favor of Jerico as there is no novation of the Construction Contract. Novation is never presumed, and may only take place when the following are present: (1) a previous valid obligation; (2) the agreement of all the parties to the new contract; (3) the extinguishment of the old contract; and (4) validity of the new one. There must be consent of all the parties to the substitution, resulting in the extinction of the old obligation and the creation of a new valid one. In this case, the revision of the work schedule of Ivan and the subcontractors is not shown to be so substantial as to extinguish the old contract, and there was also no irreconcilable incompatibility between the old and new obligations. It has also been held in jurisprudence that a surety may only be relieved of his undertaking if there is a material change in the\n\nprincipal contract and such would make the obligation of the surety onerous. The principal contract subject of the Surety agreement still exists, and Jojo is still bound as a surety.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER\n\nI will decide against Jerico. The provisions of the Civil Code (CC) on Guarantee, other than the benefit of excussion (Article 2059 (2) CC), are applicable and available to the surety because a surety is a guarantor who binds himself solidarily (Article 2047 2nd par.CC). The Supreme Court has held that there is no reason why the provisions of Article 2079 would not apply to a surety (Autocorp Group v. Intra Strata Assurance Corporation, G.R. No. 166662, June 27, 2008, 556 SCRA 250). Article 2079 of the Civil Code provides that an extension granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guaranty. The changes in the work schedule amount to an extension granted to the debtor without the consent of the surety. Hence, Jojo‘s obligation as a surety is extinguished. If the change of work schedule, on the other hand, shortens the time of completion of the project, it will amount to a novation. The old obligation, where Jojo was obligated as a surety is extinguished relatively as to him, leaving Ivan as still bound.\n\nB.Contracts\n\n"

    "text": "74. A contract to sell is the same as a conditional contract of sale. Do you agree? Explain your answer. (2012 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nNO. A contract to sell is specie of conditional sale. The contract to sell does not sell a thing or property; it sells the right to buy the property. A conditional sale is a sale subject to the happening or performance of a condition, such as payment of the full purchase price, or the performance of other prestation to give, to do, or not to do. Compliance with the condition automatically gives the right to the vendee to demand the delivery of the object of the sale. In a contract to sell, however, the compliance with the condition does not automatically sell the property to the vendee. It merely gives the vendee the right to compel the vendor to execute the deed of absolute sale.\n\n"
